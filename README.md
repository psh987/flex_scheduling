# Flexibility scheduling and dispatch

This repository contains the data for the simulation setup of the experiments of the paper "Risk-aware Scheduling and Dispatch of Flexibility Events in Buildings". It is split up into the folders
- parameters, containing the hyperparameters of the Energym simulation models
- envelopes, containing the flexibility envelope data used for the scalability experiments.

Both folders contain additional descriptions for their data.
