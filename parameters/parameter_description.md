# Parameter description

This folder contains the building parameters of all buildings used in the experimental part of the paper. The base for all buildings is the [SimpleHouseRad-v0](https://bsl546.github.io/energym-pages/sources/houserad.html#simplehouserad) model from Energym. Under "envelope_parameters", the building characteristics are listed, defining the parameters:
- thermal_capacity
- thermal_conductance
- heatpump_maximum_power
- heat_pump_nominal_COP
- solar_gain (not changed in the experiments)
